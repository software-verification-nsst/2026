(** Note on Rocq versions: if the [Require Import] section below fails saying
    something like [library XXX is required from root Stdlib and has not been
    found in the loadpath!], then it probably means you are using an older
    version of Rocq. Try changing [Stdlib] everywhere into [Rocq]. *)

(** Some words of advice/hints before you even get started on the
    assignment:

    - When you have an hypothesis of the form [H : P /\ Q], you want to
      be able to manipulate, individually, [P] and [Q]. Use [destruct
      H] to split the former hypothesis into two individual hypotheses
      [H1 : P] and [H2 : Q].

    - When you have an hypothesis of the form [H: exists x, P], you know
      indeed that there is an [x] that satisfies property [P]. Use
      [destruct H] to introduce just argument in your context.

    - When faced with a goal of the form [P /\ Q], you want to focus
      first on the proof of [P] and then on the proof of [Q]. In other
      words, you want to generate two cases, one for the proof of [P]
      the other for the proof of [Q]. Use [split] to instruct Rocq to
      generate such cases.

    - When faced with a goal of the form [P <-> Q], this stands for the
      equivalence of [P] with [Q]. This is exactly as if you were
      trying to prove two different lemmas: first that [P -> Q], and
      then that [Q -> P]. Use [split] to instruct Rocq to generate such
      cases.

    - When faced with a goal of the form [exists x, P], you want to find
      out some witness (in other words, a value) that satisfies
      [P]. When you find out such a value, lets call it [y], you just
      need to do [exists y] and the proof will continue with goal [P] where
      every occurrence of [x] has been replaced by [y].

    - From time to time, you find yourself with an hypothesis [H : P]
      where you know [P] is a false statement, i.e., a
      contradiction. That is fine, sometimes this just stands for an
      unreachable point in your implementation or proof. In that case,
      use [discriminate H] in order to instruct Rocq to exploit such a
      contradiction and finish the proof (remember: with a
      contradiction as an hypothesis everything can be proved, so the
      proof finishes immediately as soon as you are able to convince
      Rocq [H] is indeed a contradiction).

    - Do not forget that you can use other Lemmas during your
      proofs. In fact, for some of the exercises, you are supposed to
      use Lemmas that you have already proved. Also, you should be
      able to use some auxiliary Lemmas from the Rocq Standard
      Library. The [Search] command can help you find useful Lemmas
      already proved (either your own or from Rocq). *)
